I am a motivated, curious, and knowledgeable technology professional who loves to design and build highly scalable, easy to manage infrastructure environments. I have successfully facilitated four acquisitions by Yahoo!, Google, and Gemini. I won Techcrunch Disrupt 2015 with my previous venture, Agrilyst/Artemis (now iUNU).
