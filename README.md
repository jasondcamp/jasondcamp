### Jason Camp (he/him)
https://jason.camp/

I am a driven and well-informed technology expert with a passion for designing and constructing scalable and efficient infrastructure systems. My primary objective is to collaborate with skilled professionals to produce outstanding products. My track record includes facilitating acquisitions by industry leaders such as Yahoo!, Google (twice), and Gemini. I had the privilege of securing a victory at Techcrunch Disrupt 2015 with my former initiative, Agrilyst/Artemis, which has since evolved into iUNU.
